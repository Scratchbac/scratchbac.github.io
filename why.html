 “You are not only responsible for what you say, but also for what you do not say” supposed Martin Luther: a friar and scholar of relative anonymity, oft confused with the more recent Martin Luther King of the American Civil Rights Movement. I for one have never been very responsible for what I have said. However one summer night I had a revelation, that I should compensate for the former by trying to be more responsible for the latter. This epiphany has taken on a life of its own and led to my own army bookouts descending into madness. I don’t know how long this idea for a website conceived by this epiphany is going to last, but here it is.
