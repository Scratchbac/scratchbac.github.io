## ESTABLISH

In a subcontinent mired in contradictions: a colorful cacophony of splendor and squalor resounding a paper's thickness away and more often than appear as one and the same. A mere snapshot would do no justice to the unabated circus of life and death that simply overwhelms an unready spectator. Where the profane struggles to assemble anything that resembles order. However here purposeful rectilinear urban blocks emerge against the encircling chaos of wayward dirt paths and mismanaged infrastructure that had come into existence piecemeal, every piece in a violent hurry for some one man’s purpose. Euclidean geometry willed against the organic dynamics of non-linearity. Perhaps this will could be explained away as the conjurings of the bureaucratic nucleus cloistered at the heart of the borough. Yet a distant pulse drowns this intuition. Averting one's gaze few miles south uncovers the underlying, both in the literal and figurative sense, beat of the heart that this urban edifice drums along to. A topography of open wounds unfurls. Towering terraced bowls stagger into a downward descend pursuing veins of lignite. Relics of a lost geography; what were once contours of the land displaced by retaining walls and stabilized slope. The superconstruct of detritus stands silent, witness to 2600 ton of German engineering ingurgitating through its underbelly as the various industrial mechanizations reshape this landscape not unlike how an artisanal potter molds malleable clay into the form he sees fit at the bustling Night Bazaar. Paired with a thermal power station built under the Indo-Soviet assistance programme it was the realization of the Nehruvian vision of an energy bridge for the Indian economy into the future. Nonetheless, the barren blanched lunarlike canvas serves only to betray the scope of mankind’s uneasy and disquieting relationship with nature. It's an revelation of the unrestrained violence required to assemble our supply chains and markets: a form of decentralised planetary disassembly, mortal structure derived from perpetual discord. A reflection of the wider metabolism of our contemporary society that has been hijacked by the fuels that lay beneath. Second, it would appear only in importance to the grain that feeds us. Thus we encounter the grand contradiction that lies within the deal of modernity that transcends far beyond the mere spatiality of subterranean shafts and bureaucratic warrens of a small township, where I was born into the modern covenant.

The bedrock state of a system which is in conformity with the chance distribution of its elements has been called ‘entropy’, a term that summarizes the conclusions of Carnot, Clausius, and their successors concerning thermic engines and thermodynamics. With the concept of entropy everything changes. Natural processes are no longer eternal clockwork machines, they are either extinct (Wärmetod) or tendential. Mechanisms are subordinated to motors; to thermic difference, energy flux, reservoir, and sump. Order is an evanescent chance, a deviation from disorder, a disequilibrium. Negative disorder—negentropy—is an energetic resource, and chance is the potentiation of the power supply. Macht, puissance, as potential for the degradation of energy, as the fluidification of matter/energy, as the possibility of release towards the unregulated or anarchic abyss into which energy pours, as the death of God. Upstream and downstream; the reserve and its dissipation. Order is not law but power, and power is aberration.

--- ALAN MOORE, WATCHMEN

The emergence of life appears to be an incongruency - one that has induced in humanity a spectra of existential dread and grandeur, alienation and splendor. Rivers of ink have flowed, a thousand flags flown and regimes flouted in an attempt to define mere facets of the gem that is Life. A multiplicity of ideas have been floated to compile a set of properties that unite the living and exclude the naught. For every rule that ranges from response to stimuli to self organisation there sits an exception. Viruses(and their virtual counterparts), immortal jellyfish, cities that grow and decay, some responsive Boston Dynamics robot and tardigrade water bears, all exceptional in their own right. Where exactly does the mountain end and where do the plains begin? Where does V A P O R W A V E begin and smooth jazz end? Am I just playing a game of grammar, exercising a linguistic sleight of hand? We categorize and partition the world into arbitrary buckets; we draw lines over the world, dividing it into sections; we establish boundaries, we approximate the world by breaking it down. We think of these entities in terms of concepts that are meaningful for us to interact with, that emerge at a certain scale. If so the boundary we seek to define that lies between the animate and the inanimate, as we intuit it, may remain undefinable or tentatively blurred.

From an elemental rule set of events and relations, structural and organizational complexity of visible matter has burst forth across incomprehensible scales. One that ranges from a primeval hydrogen atom to galactic  filaments that stretch light years across. Matter seeks stable forms haplessly. It is more stable forms are more resilient against forces of decay persisting across longer time frames. Stretching this fact to its conclusion naturally yields a tendency for matter to coalesce into forms resembling life-like properties without any need for agency. (EXPOUND on kinetic dynamic stability)
The living are just another continuum on this landscape of complexity albeit one we have a personal stake in. For is it not iron from the heart of a dying star that courses through our veins.

Of course, the distinction between the organic and the inorganic is without final usefulness, because organic matter is only a name for that fragment of inorganic material that has been woven into meta-stable regional compositions. Both an encapsulation of its physical environment and of the physical environment, it operates within the context of its surrounding environment while also transcending beyond it.
the fate inherent to energy is utter waste.

Energy from the sun is discharged unilaterally and without design. Earth intercepts a minuscule fraction of solar radiation, determined by simple geometric parameters. That fraction of solar radiation which strikes the earth resources all terrestrial endeavour, provoking the feverish obscenity we call ‘life’. Our import driven planetary energy economy derives nearly all its free energy from photons borne via proton-proton reaction within the fiery crucible that is the Sun’s core. Our biosphere as an open system incessantly imports the continuous flow of solar energy, which arrives at our planet’s upper atmosphere at rates of about 174 petawatts.  Vast sectors of our global ecosystem are built on the foundation of the photosynthetic capture of this immense energetic flow along with its subsequent conversion and distribution so as to build and maintain the greater order, organization and structure of the biosphere. Life in all its richness and splendor is not in violation of this universality but is instead born to it.

Life appears as a pause on the energy path; as a precarious stabilization and complication of solar decay. It is most basically comprehensible as the general solution to the problem of consumption. Such a solar- or general-economic perspective exhibits production as an illusion; the hypostatization of a digression in consumption. To produce is to partially manage the release of energy into its loss, and nothing more.  Death, wastage, or expenditure is the only end, the only definitive terminus. ‘Utility’ cannot in reality be anything but the characterization of a function, having no sense short of an expenditure which escapes it utterly. This is ‘relative utility’. The order of Western history has as its most pertinent symptom the drift of utility away from this relative sense, towards a paradoxical absolute value. A creeping slave morality colonizes value, subordinating it to the definition ‘that which serves’. The ‘good’ becomes synonymous with utility; with means, mediation, instrumentality, and implicit dependence. The real trajectory of loss is ‘immanence’, continuity, base matter, or flow. Precisely why although we know for a fact that energy is conserved, the energy available for human utility is not conserved at all easily. If the strictly regional resistance of everything that delays, impedes, or momentarily arrests the movement of dissolution is abstracted from the solar flow it is interpretable as transcendence. just as salmon would return upstream to perish at the origin. Thermospasm is howl, annihilating intensity, a peak of improbability.
Life in this sense is merely a vessel for death.

Energetic matter has a tendency, a Todestrieb. The current scientific sense of this movement is a perpetual degradation of energy or dissipation of difference. Upstream is the reservoir of negentropy, uneven distribution, thermic disequilibrium. Downstream is Tohu Bohu, statistical disorder, indifference, Wärmetod. The second law ofthermodynamics tells us that disorder must increase, that regional increases in negentropy still imply an aggregate increase in entropy. Life is able to deviate from death only because it also propagates it

How this peculiar terrain of complexity unfolded remains a particular mystery. The leading hypothesis   Choreography Life optimises sustained fitness Co-evolving systems act in concert as the results of the dynamic of the system they do so as a result of individuals within the community myopically optimising their own ends and not as collective agreement toward a common goal. A critical process in the organisation of biodiversity specifically because it is simultaneously flexible yet conservative in how it shares interspecific intersections in a dynamic world.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/entropy/supercell.gif" alt="Eye of the Hurricane" caption="The forces that life arose from probably emulated the behavior of systems that are dissipative, which are deeply coupled to their external environment and strongly driven by external sources of energy" %}

Life can be described as a open dissipative process driven by an energy gradient that while reduces entropy locally nonetheless increases the entropy of its surroundings. Environmental perturbation generates a signal that initiates a corrective response. Systems that fail to do this are rapidly eliminated by natural selection. A sort of pre-biological Darwinism. Stable systems respond to perturbations in ways that nullify or reduce their disequilibrium effects by means of negative feedback assuring variations within systems do not exceed a certain homeostatic plateau. Thus, despite the energy cost of storing and utilizing information, information processing augurs a clear distinct edge in determining the anti-fragility of the system. Across vast timescales biomolecular machinery regulated by informational flows has evolved to be increasingly sophisticated at manipulating the free energies involved within its energy landscape streamlining the opera of life into a highly efficient tightly orchestrated operation.

All multicellular life forms require cell to cell adhesion and sophisticated intercellular communication. Systems of intercommunication are essentiality for growth and structural integrity. The greater information carrying capacity of eukaryotic cells was a definite prerequisite for this of course. Constellations of networked structures interacted and evolved over spatial and temporal scales
 Perhaps life is to be experienced and not to be explicable.

Entropy, as stated in the Second Law of Thermodynamics, is a measurement of the instinctive state of highly disordered equilibrium toward which energy tends. In a closed system the availability of useful energy can only decline. A lump of coal is a high quality highly ordered form of energy which upon combustion will produce heat a dispersed disordered form of energy. To reverse this sequence is brain-bendingly impossible as the products for such a reaction cannot be reconstituted back into a lump of coal. Ice cubes melting. Hopelessly attempting to write non-messy software. And the Iran Nuclear Deal. In every sequence of events that looks weird if we ran it in reverse we notice this universal tendency playing out. Elegant creatures like pterodactyls, iguanas or orcas haven't arisen out of the benevolence or malevolence of an intelligent designer. You are after all a being of highly intricate structure and complexity. If I threw all your rich organic matter into a giant fruit blender, there are a far greater number of possible arrangements of the end states of the system in which it resembles a gooey sludge rather than that of one assuming a humanoid form.

The entire becoming of the cosmos can be defined as the gradual unraveling of disorder. A halting and subsequent leaping of entropic growth which is neither expeditious nor uniform. Vast regions of matter and energy may remain for prolonged periods trapped in configurations of local stability and order till there too channels for such growth open. An unopened dam in the mountains. A primordial nebula of contracting hydrogen. Yugoslavia. All states merely transitory, bound to be distant memories drowned out by the inexorable dance of entropy.

The caveat that enables our local system to derive such order from the theatrical thermodynamic chaos of the universe is an entirely one sided cosmic trade deal.
the strictures of the second law are temporarily smoothed out in the more shallow dissipation function provided by conservation of energy in the web of coupled electrochemical and metabolic reactions. Indeed, the accumulated order and chemical complexity of the biosphere is a direct consequence of this entropic delay.

A planet bejeweled in the dead of the night
To orchestrate such sophisticated expressions of energetic utility would be impossible without the continuous supply and servicing of various inputs. A direction beyond our own making. Though supposedly operating within no more than 5% of the planetary surface, urbanism reconfigures close to 70% of the planetary terrain. A highly complex web of metabolic and informational exchange pathways crisscross the earth’s surface, both terrestrial and oceanic, across both spatiality and temporality. Not only is the hand that weaves much of this 4 Dimensional Web invisible it is blind as well. As the webs of ever thickening commodity chains, infrastructural circuits, migratory streams and circulatory-logistical networks expand and ensnare in a planetary logistical assemblage. The oft-repeated mantra that a supposed global urban transition has recently occurred due to the putative fact that over half of the world’s population now lives within cities does not even begin to do justice analytical, representational and political complexities associated with grasping the planetary dimensions of the urban condition.
It's system wide in causality and impact and  thus not convertible into compelling cultural forms that transmit danger and urgency. Few challenges facing civilization during the twenty-first-century will be as daunting, and as critical, as the preservation of the biosphere’s integrity.
We are chronicling the 6th planetary extinction event in real time.
Our energetic backbone defines the scope and limits of our visions for the future, like a waiter that demarcates our appetites by handing us a menu. The canals we have built to channel this energetic flux are crumbling under their own narrative weight. These growth predicated institutions much like a seasoned used car salesman obfuscate and obscure the fundamental reality underlying this unscalable growth regime model.
Yesterdays articles of faith are crumbling leaving behind a disorientating husk. What once was pronounced eternal and sacred appear to be merely illusionary veils swept away by the ever-mutating winds of change. The hijacking of the global operating system by the concept of open ended exponential growth has borne myopic growth predicated institutions. However this operating system along with its institutions are not scalable into the 21st Century and haven't been for a while. What awaits isn't a world defined by some celestial tranquility. The trappings of modernity is instead defined by uncertainty, volatility and turbulence, a deal offered without options for renegotiation. All fixed relations and ancient prejudices are swept away like sand, and new structures become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air. It isn’t easy to live in such a chaotic world, and it is even harder to govern it.

## The Thanos Trap
Balance in all things ~
Collectively humanity now mobilizes unprecedented social and functional metabolism. We churn the cauldrons of creation materialising truths. Our capacities stretched as cycles of innovation shrink. This dynamic is irreconcilable with fundamental biological timescales. At the atomised individual scale one can expect to see several major disruptions within our lifetime , one our socioeconomic fabric as of now is simply not woven to sustain. A truth betrayed by our fragile institutions who appear to have developed a serious allergy with ground realities.

As a system moves toward increasing instability it may reach a point where two sets of values for its parameters and hence two different states are equally viable. (In its phase portrait as a dynamical system this is referred to as a bifurcation.) But which state will it “choose”? There is no way of knowing since the system’s behavior has become indeterminate at this point. The very presence of a bifurcation means that the system is falling under the influence of a different attractor and thus undergoing a dynamical change as a whole.
